## Real-Time-Group-Chat
The real-time group chat application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface. The backend is deployed using AWS Chalice, a Python serverless microframework, to handle WebSocket connections and message handling, potentially using AWS services like Amazon DynamoDB for data storage.
Backend code available at https://aws.github.io/chalice/tutorials/wschat.html
